          The neon hums outside your window. Rain taps the glass in sync with
          the buzz of distant ads. Welcome to VA-11 HALL-A — a small bar tucked
          between alleyways, where androids, hackers, and broken hearts find
          solace in a glass of something strong.

            <h3>A Drink for Every Memory</h3>
            <p>
              From the classic Piano Woman to the bittersweet Bad Touch, each
              drink tells a story. It's not about what they order — it's about
              what they need.

            <p>
              Jill isn't just a bartender — she's an emotional operator.
              Conversations uncover truths, fears, regrets... and sometimes,
              revolutions.

            <p>
              Between corporate overlords and rebellious AIs, Glitch City pulses
              with secrets. Everyone has a past. Everyone wants an escape.
